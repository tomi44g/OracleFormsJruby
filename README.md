Sample scripts modifying Oracle Forms modules using JRuby and Oracle JDAPI


This project contains just a collection of scripts I created as a part of UI Modernisation project of a Legacy Sytem built using Oracle Forms 10g

I just wanted to share those script to those who will need to modify Oracle Forms modules in bulk, using JRuby and JDAPI proved to be fast and easy way of doing that.

You will need to modify those scripts but I hope you will find it helpful.



Dependencies
================
- Oracle Developer Suite: particularly: frmjdapi.jar, xmlparserv2.jar, xschema.jar
- JRuby: the easiest way is to use the jruby-complete-1.6.7.jar

Licence
================
for the JRuby scripts: http://freedomdefined.org/Licenses/CC-BY
